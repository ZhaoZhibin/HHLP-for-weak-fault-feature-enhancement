"[**Hierarchical hyper-Laplacian prior for weak fault feature enhancement**](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.isatra.2019.06.007)"

## About
Sparsity-assisted methods are one of the most effective fault feature extraction methods which have been widely studied recently. However, no one has explained or discussed the choice of a suitable sparse prior from the perspective of the probability theory. In this paper, we define a hierarchical hyper-Laplacian prior induced model (HHLP) through maximizing the posterior probability for bearing fault diagnosis. In the proposed model, we conclude that the hyper-Laplacian prior can better model coefficients of fault feature than the Laplacian prior. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical hyper-Laplacian prior which embeds the physical characteristics to discriminate the harmonic interference. The main insight of this paper is that we provide a new way to model the sparse prior from the perspective of maximizing the posterior probability.
